What is a Pointer in C?
A pointer is a derived data type in C that can store the address of other variables or a memory. We can access and manipulate the data stored in that memory location using pointers.

Syntax of C Pointers
datatype * pointer_name;
The above syntax is the generic syntax of C pointers. The actual syntax depends on the type of data the pointer is pointing to.
